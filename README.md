Term:**ety-mod-ology**

**Definition**: A neologism/non-word for the study of how one can build models of semantic content with etymology.
_________________________________________________

**Description of purpose**

Application used to experiment with a wide array of technologies. The goal is to extract semantic content from etymological information, and build models of alternative meanings of sentences. no idea what will come of project. technologies word. Chat gpt created a stack for me to learn and follow so I' run with it. As of June 24th, I remain ignorant as to how many of these Here we go! 

TLdr, I have an idea and I only partially know what im doing. ** Trying to learn on the go!**

Technologies to learn and use
_______________________________________________

**Frontend Technologies**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript Framework: React.js Purpose: To build a user-friendly, interactive web interface for your chatbot. 

**Backend Language:** Java Framework: Spring Boot Purpose: Handles server-side logic, manages API endpoints, and ensures robst integration with the SQL database and Python services for NLP tasks. 

**Python Service Language**: Python Frameworks: Flask or FastAPI Purpose: Handles specific NLP tasks that leverage Python's rich ecosystem, interfacing with the Java backend via microservices. 

**Database Type**: SQL Technology: PostgreSQL (recommended for its robustness and feature set) Purpose: Stores user data, chat logs, and other necessary data. SQL databases provide strong consistency, transactions, and are often preferred for complex queries and data integrity. 

**Cloud Platform Provider**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Services: Compute Engine, Cloud SQL, Cloud Functions Purpose: To host and scale the application, manage the SQL database efficiently, and handle serverless computing tasks.

**DevOps Tools Containerization**: Docker Orchestration: Kubernetes (if scaling is needed) CI/CD: GitHub Actions Purpose: Ensures smooth deployment, scalability, and maintenance of the application.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
